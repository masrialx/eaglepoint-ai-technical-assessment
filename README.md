# EaglePoint AI Technical Assessment

## Overview
This repository contains my submission for the EaglePoint AI Technical Assessment for the **Full-Stack Developer** position.  
I have completed **Task 1 – Smart Text Analyzer** and **Task 3 – Rate Limiter** using **Python**.  

All code is clean, well-documented, and tested with example inputs. Detailed documentation explains my thought process, searches, and implementation decisions.

If you want, I can **also write a ready-to-paste submission message for the Google Form** that points reviewers to the repo and both task folders neatly.  

Do you want me to do that?
